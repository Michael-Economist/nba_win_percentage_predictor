Module 4 Final Project - NBA Win Percentage Prediction Modeling

## Project Formalization:
An analysis of NBA team statistics for the years 1996- 2019 with the goal of developing a model for predicting the team win percentage and in so doing, the likelihood of winning an NBA title. Do to time constraints we used the NBA's basic stats; the advanced stats would have greater predictive value.  Nonethless, those may be suitable for a more indepth project at a later time.
